# StarkNet Playground

My lil' playground. Feeling cute, might port some of my Solidity contracts here, idk.

## Getting started

Clone this project:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/exp-table/starknet-playground.git
cd starknet-playground
```

Create a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and activate it:

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install `nile`:

```sh
pip install cairo-nile
```

Use `nile` to quickly set up your development environment:

```sh
nile init
...
‚ú®  Cairo successfully installed!
...
‚úÖ Dependencies successfully installed
üóÑ  Creating project directory tree
‚õµÔ∏è Nile project ready! Try running:
```
This command creates the project directory structure and installs `cairo-lang`, `starknet-devnet`, `pytest`, and `pytest-asyncio` for you. The template includes a makefile to build the project (`make build`) and run tests (`make test`).
